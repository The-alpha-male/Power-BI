### Data-set
The data set can be downloaded from the file uploaded named `Power-BI learning` which is an actual dataset collected from an online survey of data professionals.The survey as taken on linkedin and twitter by AlexTheAnalyst. Link to original dataset on his githib account [HERE](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Power-BI/blob/main/Power%20BI%20-%20Final%20Project.xlsx) 

## Data cleaning and preparation
Started cleaning the dataset by removing the following columns
- `browser`
- `city`
- `country`
- `reference`

Cleaned the `current role ` column
  
The above columns were irrelevant and empty as they were left out during the survey to give the survey takers some privacy on their data
